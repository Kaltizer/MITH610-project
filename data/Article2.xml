        <p><measure type="people" quantity="40">Forty</measure> University of Maryland
<persName>students</persName> attempted sit-ins Sat­
urday at five College Park area
restaurants. There were no <orgName ref="#PD">ar<lb/>­
rests</orgName>.</p>
<p>The <persName>students</persName>, members of
<orgName ref="#CORE">CORE</orgName>, were served without in­<lb/>
cident at <placeName>Ledo’s Restaurant</placeName> and
the <placeName>Federal Diner</placeName>, but were re­<lb/>
fused service at <placeName>Jimmy Comb­er’s</placeName>, the <placeName>College Inn</placeName>,and the
<placeName>Olde Dutch Inn</placeName>. A few non-stu­<lb/>
dents demonstrated with the
group.</p>
<p>Nineteen white and <persName ref="#BLK">Negro
students</persName> sat in the main dining
room of <placeName>Jimmy Comber’s</placeName>
<measure type="time" quantity="4" unit="hour">four hours</measure> while small, rotating
<persName>groups</persName> picketed outside on the
sidewalk facing <placeName>University
Boulevard</placeName>.</p>
<p>The <persName>picketers</persName> marched, brac­<lb/>
ing against the wind, singing
<l>“Woke up this morning with my
mind set on freedom.”</l> They
bore placards reading <l>“Make
the Free State Free for All,”</l>
and <l>"“Service for All Citizens.”</l>
Inside the restaurant, Jimmy
Comber told Diamondback re­<lb/>
porters, “I don’t mind serving
<persName ref="#BLK">colored people</persName>. I don’t care one
way or another; but I think my clientele would mind, so I don’t
serve them.</p>
<p>“I wish the state of Mary­
land would pass a law requir­<lb/>
ing equal service so that I
could serve everyone without
objection from my regular customers.”</p>
<p>Two men walked into the <placeName>res­<lb/>
taurant</placeName> and offered to bring in
dogs to “clean out the place.”
Comber ordered them off the
premises.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. the <persName ref="#BLK">sit-inners</persName> left
en masse accompanied by de­<lb/>
risive applause from the patrons of the restaurant.
A smaller group of <persName ref="#BLK">demon­strators</persName> was locked out of the
<placeName>College Inn</placeName> on <placeName>Route 1</placeName> before
they could gain entrance. They
were ordered off the premises
by county <orgName ref="#PD">police</orgName> and not allow­<lb/>
ed to picket because the <placeName>Inn's property</placeName>
extended to <placeName>Route 1</placeName>.
Another <persName>group</persName> was locked out of <placeName>Terrapin Inn</placeName>.</p>
<p> <measure type="people" quantity="6">Six </measure> <persName ref="#BLK"> students </persName> were refused
service at <placeName>Ye Olde Dutch Inn</placeName> in
<placeName>Riverdale</placeName>. The waitress told
them that it was not the <placeName>res­<lb/>
taurant’s</placeName> policy to serve mixed
groups. The group read the
<l>fourteenth amendment</l> to the
manager and left.</p>
<p><persName ref="MAR"><forename>Marvin A.</forename><surname>Raps</surname></persName>, president of
the <placeName>Prince George's County</placeName>
<orgName ref="#CORE">CORE</orgName>, called the demonstra­<lb/>
tions “very effective.”</p>
<p><persName ref="#MAR">Raps</persName> is a graduate student at <orgName ref="UMD">Maryland</orgName>.
He was <orgName ref="#PD">arrested</orgName> on
<date when="1962-01-27">Jan. 27</date> at a sit-in at <placeName>Park Col­<lb/>
lege Diner</placeName>. The case was thrown
out.</p>
