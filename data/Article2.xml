        <p><measure type="people" quantity="40">Forty</measure> University of Maryland
<persName ref="#BLK">students</persName> attempted sit-ins Sat­urday at <placeName ref="SEG">five College Park area
restaurants</placeName>. There were no ar<lb/>­
rests.</p>
<p>The <persName>students</persName>, members of
<orgName ref="#CORE">CORE</orgName>, were served without in­<lb/>
cident at <placeName ref="SEG">Ledo’s Restaurant</placeName> and
the <placeName>Federal Diner</placeName>, but were re­<lb/>
fused service at <placeName ref="SEG">Jimmy Comb­er’s</placeName>, the <placeName ref="SEG">College Inn</placeName>,and the
<placeName ref="SEG">Olde Dutch Inn</placeName>. A few non-stu­<lb/>
dents demonstrated with the
group.</p>
<p>Nineteen white and <persName ref="#BLK">Negro
students</persName> sat in the main dining
room of <placeName ref="SEG">Jimmy Comber’s</placeName>
<measure type="time" quantity="4" unit="hour">four hours</measure> while small, rotating
<persName ref="#BLK">groups</persName> picketed outside on the
sidewalk facing <placeName>University
Boulevard</placeName>.</p>
<p>The <persName ref="BLK">picketers</persName> marched, brac­<lb/>
ing against the wind, singing
“Woke up this morning with my
mind set on freedom.” They
bore placards reading “Make
the Free State Free for All,”
and "“Service for All Citizens.”
Inside the <placeName ref="SEG">restaurant</placeName>, Jimmy
Comber told Diamondback re­<lb/>
porters, “I don’t mind serving
<persName ref="#BLK">colored people</persName>. I don’t care one
way or another; but I think my clientele would mind, so I don’t
serve them.</p>
<p>“I wish the state of Mary­
land would pass a law requir­<lb/>
ing equal service so that I
could serve everyone without
objection from my regular customers.”</p>
<p>Two men walked into the <placeName ref="SEG">res­<lb/>
taurant</placeName> and offered to bring in
dogs to “clean out the place.”
Comber ordered them off the
premises.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. the <persName ref="#BLK">sit-inners</persName> left
en masse accompanied by de­<lb/>
risive applause from the patrons of the <placeName ref="SEG">restaurant</placeName>.
A smaller group of <persName ref="#BLK">demon­strators</persName> was locked out of the
<placeName ref="SEG">College Inn</placeName> on <placeName>Route 1</placeName> before
they could gain entrance. They
were ordered off the premises
by county <orgName ref="#PD">police</orgName> and not allow­<lb/>
ed to picket because the <placeName ref="SEG">Inn's property</placeName>
extended to <placeName>Route 1</placeName>.
Another <persName ref="#BLK">group</persName> was locked out of <placeName ref="SEG">Terrapin Inn</placeName>.</p>
<p> <measure type="people" quantity="6">Six </measure> <persName ref="#BLK">students</persName> were refused
service at <placeName ref="SEG">Ye Olde Dutch Inn</placeName> in
<placeName ref="SEG">Riverdale</placeName>. The waitress told
them that it was not the <placeName ref ="SEG">res­<lb/>
taurant’s</placeName> policy to serve mixed
groups. The group read the
fourteenth amendment to the
manager and left.</p>
<p><persName ref="MAR"><forename>Marvin A.</forename><surname>Raps</surname></persName>, president of
the <placeName>Prince George's County</placeName>
<orgName ref="#CORE">CORE</orgName>, called the demonstra­<lb/>
tions “very effective.”</p>
<p><persName ref="#MAR">Raps</persName> is a graduate student at <orgName ref="UMD">Maryland</orgName>.
He was <orgName ref="#PD">arrested</orgName> on
<date when="1962-01-27">Jan. 27</date> at a sit-in at <placeName ref="SEG">Park Col­<lb/>
lege Diner</placeName>. The case was thrown
out.</p>
