         <p>Forty University of Maryland
students attempted sit-ins Sat­
urday at five College Park area
restaurants. There were no ar<l/>­
rests.</p>
<p>The students, members of
<orgName>COKE</orgName>, were served without in­<l/>
cident at <placeName>Ledo’s Restaurant</placeName> and
the <placeName>Federal Diner</placeName>, but were re­<l/>
fused service at Jimmy Comb­<l/>
er’s, the <placeName>College Inn</placeName>,and the
<placeName>Olde Dutch Inn</placeName>. A few non-stu­<l/>
dents demonstrated with the
group.</p>
<p>Nineteen white and Negro
students sat in the main dining
room of Jimmy Comber’s
four hours while small, rotating
groups picketed outside on the
sidewalk facing <placeName>University
Boulevard</placeName>.</p>
<p>The picketers marched, brac­<l/>
ing against the wind, singing
“Woke up this morning with my
mind set on freedom.” They
bore placards reading “Make
the Free State Free for All,”
and “Service for All Citizens.”
Inside the restaurant, <persName>Jimmy
Comber</persName> told Diamondback re­<l/>
porters, “I don’t mind serving
colored people. I don’t care one
way or another; but I think my
clientele would mind, so I don’t
serve them.</p>
<p>“I wish the state of Mary­
land would pass a law requir­<l/>
ing equal service so that I
could serve everyone without
objection from my regular cus­<l/>
tomers.”</p>
<p>Two men walked into the res­<l/>
taurant and offered to bring in
dogs to “clean out the place.”
<persName>Comber</persName> ordered them off the
premises.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. the sit-inners left
en masse accompanied by de­<l/>
risive applause from the pa­<l/>
trons of the restaurant.
A smaller group of demon­<l/>
strators was locked out of the
<placeName>College Inn</placeName> on <placeName>Route 1</placeName> before
they could gain entrance. They
were ordered off the premises
by county <orgName>police</orgName> and not allow­<l/>
ed to picket because the Inn’s
property extended to <placeName>Route 1<placeName>.
Another group was locked out
of the <placeName>Terrapin Inn</placeName>.</p>
<p>Six students were refused
service at <placeName>Ye Olde Dutch Inn</placeName> in
<placeName>Riverdale</placeName>. The waitress told
them that it was not the res­<l/>
taurant’s policy to serve mixed
groups. The group read the
fourteenth amendment to the
<persName>manager</persName> and left.</p>

out.</p>
