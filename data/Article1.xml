        <p>The Negro college woman no
longer waits for acceptance by
white society. She has her own
culture, according to a <orgName>Federal
City College</orgName> official.</p>
<p>This was the brunt of the speech
given by <persName><forename>Barbara</forename><surname>Hatton</surname></persName>,
as­<lb/>
sistant dean of student services
at <orgName>FCC</orgName>, to an attentive audience
of about 600 at a <orgName>Panhellenic</orgName> con­<lb/>
ference in the <placeName>chapel</placeName> Saturday
morning.</p
of about 600 at a Panhellenic con­<lb/>
ference in the <placeName>chapel</placeName> <date=" 1969-04-12">Saturday
morning</date>.</p>
<p>Speaking without notes, <persName>Miss
Hatton</persName> attempted to give the
sorority girls an idea of where
the greek system stands in re­<lb/>
lation to racial integration.</p>
<p>“Rushing out and bringing
people (blacks) into a white thing
isn’t wanted anymore,” <persName>Miss
  <surname>Hatton</surname></persName> said.</p>
<p>According to her, black col­<lb/>
lege women now have their own
concept of beauty and culture
and it has nothing to do with the
“narrow concepts we get from
TV."</p>
<p>Black women do not want to
be accepted as equal,<persName>Miss Hat<lb/>­
ton</persName> said.</p>
<p>“We want to be accepted as we
are; black with our own way of
doing things. I don’t like to
explain away black folks. An
explanation shouldn’t be needed.”
An attitude generally confused
with good race relations is to “go
around loving everybody,” she
said.</p>
<p>“You can’t possibly love
everybody you meet. What is
needed in any relationship is
pride and skills and we’ve
(blacks) got to bring these in.
That’s what we’re doing now.”</p>
<p><persName>Miss Hatton</persName> concluded by say­<lb/>
ing that the important thing for
each sorority to do is to examine
its feelings and see what is real
and meaningful in its social and
racial relations.</p>
<p>The speech was preceded by a
poetry reading by <persName>Adwole</persName>, a poet
from <orgName>Afro-American Living Arts
of Washington</orgName>. The poems ranged
in message from utopian brother­<lb/>
hood to black militancy and from
social Injustice to intermarriage. </p>
<p>The <orgName>African Heritage Dancers
and Drummers</orgName> performed three
dances; one used as a greeting,
another performed at weddings
and one in honor of a great war<lb/>f­
rior.</p>
<p>The conference also hosted a
preview of the <orgName>Black Student
  <sic>Uhion</sic> dancers</orgName>’recital. The
theme of the program was history
of the American Negro, from his
comfort in a native culture to
his search for identity now.</p>
<p>“The conference was meant
to expose the girls to this cul­<lb/>
ture,” said <persName><forename>Debbie</forename><surname>Jennings</surname></persName>, sec­<lb/>
  ond <persName>vice president</persName> of <orgName>Panhel</orgName>.
“We don’t know yet how it
will affect each sorority’s poli­<lb/>
cies.”</p>
        <p>One <persName>sorority girl</persName> commented,
“Some of the houses are really
for integration and others are
dead against it. But I think
  we’ll have some <orgName>black greeks</orgName>
next year whether some girls
want it or not. We’re under a
lot of pressure.”</p>
