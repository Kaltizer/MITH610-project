​     <​p​>​The Negro college woman no
longer waits for acceptance by
white society. She has her own
culture, according to a Federal
City <correction>College</correction> official.
This was the brunt of the speech
given by Barbara Hatton, as­
sistant dean of student services
at <organization>FCC</organization>, to an attentive audience
of about 600 at a <organization><correction>Panhellenic</correction></organization> con­
ference in the <UMD-Memorial-Chapel>chapel</UMD-Memorial-Chapel> Saturday
morning.
Speaking without notes, Miss
Hatton attempted to give the
sorority girls an idea of where
the greek system stands in re­
lation to racial integration.
“Rushing out and bringing
people <editorial-insertion>(blacks)</editorial-insertion> into a white thing
isn’t wanted anymore,” Miss
Hatton said.
According to her, black col­
lege women now have their own
concept of beauty and culture
and it has nothing to do with the
“narrow concepts we get from
TV.”
Black women do not want to
be accepted as equal, Miss Hat­
ton said.
“We want to be accepted as we
are; black with our own way of
doing things. I don’t like to
explain away black folks. An
explanation shouldn’t be needed.”
An attitude generally confused
with good race relations is to “go
around loving everybody,” she
said.
“You can’t possibly love
everybody you meet. What is
needed in any relationship is
pride and skills and we’ve
<editorial-insertion>(blacks)</editiorial-insertion> got to bring these in.
That’s what we’re doing now.”
Miss Hatton concluded by say­
ing that the important thing for
each <organization>sorority</organization> to do is to examine
its feelings and see what is real
and meaningful in its social and
racial relations.
The speech was preceded by a
poetry reading by Adwole, a poet
from <cultural-institution>Afro-American Living Arts
of Washington</cultural-institution>. The poems ranged
in message from utopian brother­
hood to black militancy and from
social Injustice to intermarriage.
The African Heritage Dancers
and Drummers performed three
dances; one used as a greeting,
another performed at weddings
and one in honor of a great war­
rior.
The conference also hosted a
preview of the Black Student
Uhion dancers’ recital. The
theme of the program was history
of the American Negro, from his
comfort in a native culture to
his search for identity now.
“The conference was meant
to expose the girls to this cul­
ture,” said Debbie Jennings, sec­
ond vice president of <organization>Panhel</organization>.
“We don’t know yet how it
will affect each sorority’s poli­
cies.”
One sorority girl commented,
“Some of the houses are really
for integration and others are
dead against it. But I think
we’ll have some black greeks
next year whether some girls
want it or not. We’re under a
lot of pressure.”
