        <p>The <persName ref="#BW">Negro college woman</persName> no
longer waits for acceptance by
<placeName>white society</placeName>. She has her own
culture, according to a <orgName ref="#FCC"> Federal
City College</orgName> official.</p>
<p>This was the brunt of the speech
given by <persName><forename>Barbara</forename><surname>Hatton</surname></persName>, as­<lb/>
sistant dean of <orgName>student services</orgName>
at <orgName ref="#FCC">FCC</orgName>, to an attentive audience
of about 600 at a <orgName ref="#PH">Panhellenic</orgName> con­<lb/>
ference in the <placeName>chapel</placeName><date>="1969-04-12"></date>Saturday
morning.</p>
<p>Speaking without notes, <persName ref="#BH">Miss<lb/>
Hatton</persName> attempted to give the
sorority girls an idea of where
the <placeName>greek system</placeName> stands in re­<lb/>
lation to racial integration.</p>
<p>“Rushing out and bringing
<persName ref="#BW">people</persName><persName ref="BLK">(blacks)</persName>into a <placeName>white thing</placeName>
isn’t wanted anymore,” <persName>Miss
  <surname>Hatton</surname></persName> said.</p>
<p>According to her, <persName ref="#BW">black
col­lege women</persName> now have their own
concept of beauty and culture
and it has nothing to do with the
“narrow concepts we get from
TV."</p>
<p><persName ref="#BW">Black women</persName> do not want to
be accepted as equal,<persName>Miss Hat<lb/>­
ton</persName> said.</p>
<p>“We want to be accepted as we
are; black with our own way of
doing things. I don’t like to
explain away black folks. An
explanation shouldn’t be needed.”
An attitude generally confused
with good race relations is to “go
around loving everybody,” she
said.</p>
<p>“You can’t possibly love
everybody you meet. What is
needed in any relationship is
pride and skills and we’ve
(blacks) got to bring these in.
That’s what we’re doing now.”</p>
<p><persName>Miss Hatton</persName> concluded by say­<lb/>
ing that the important thing for
each <orgName ref="#PH">sorority </orgName>to do is to examine
its feelings and see what is real
and meaningful in its social and
racial relations.</p>
<p>The speech was preceded by a
poetry reading by <persName>Adwole</persName>, a poet
from <orgName>Afro-American Living Arts
of Washington</orgName>. The poems ranged
in message from utopian brother­<lb/>
hood to black militancy and from
social Injustice to intermarriage. </p>
<p>The <orgName>African Heritage Dancers
and Drummers</orgName> performed three
dances; one used as a greeting,
another performed at weddings
and one in honor of a great war<lb/>
rior.</p>
<p>The conference also hosted a
preview of the <orgName>Black Student
Union dancers</orgName>’recital. The
theme of the program was history
of the American Negro, from his
comfort in a native culture to
his search for identity now.</p>
<p>“The conference was meant
to expose the girls to this cul­<lb/>
ture,” said Debbie Jennings, sec­<lb/>
ond vice president of <orgName ref="#PH">Panhel</orgName>.
“We don’t know yet how it
will affect each <placeName>sorority’s</placeName> poli­<lb/>
cies.”</p>
<p>One sorority girl commented,
“Some of the <placeName>houses</placeName> are really
for integration and others are
dead against it. But I think
we’ll have some <persName ref="#BW">black greeks</persName>
next year whether some girls
want it or not. We’re under a
lot of pressure.”</p>
