    <h1>MITH610 - Encoded Diamondback Articles</h1>
    <div id="description"><p>My encoding of these articles from the Diamondback student newspaper seeks to make explicit the archival silences, gaps, and erasures of the experiences of black and African American people on campus at the University of Maryland. I have chosen to encode these articles because they discuss two different types of spaces from which black people were excluded in College Park: sororities and restaurants. By mapping the presence of black and African American people as well as the places (both physical and institutional) from which they are excluded, it is hoped that this article will throw into relief the silences and absences that exist in the archive, outlining the archival gaps that have been created and perpetuated. In order to show this visually, I have contrasted black and African American people (indicated in blue) and segregated spaces (indicated in red). </p>
<p>The 1969 article “‘Negro woman has a culture:’ Panhel hears black dean” is unusual among Diamondback articles and in wider discourse because it features a named black female voice; yet even this recorded instance of a black female voice evidences a legacy of erasure and points to a litany of unheard voices. The article summarizes a speech given by Barbara Hatton to University of Maryland sororities. At this time, Barbara Hatton was dean and founding member of Federal City College in Washington, D.C.; she would go on to earn her Ph.D. from Stanford and would eventually become the first black female president of South Carolina State University. Despite the centrality of Barbara Hatton’s speech in the article, its content was heavily edited in order to reinforce the author’s own ideological agendas. The article rests on conceptualizations of fixed systems of cultural difference and reinforces those systems by portraying a monolithic black culture: Barbara Hatton is presumed to represent the opinions and experience of all black women. The article’s author utilizes phrases from Barbara Hatton’s speech to strategically reframe the conversation around integration by conflating cultural sameness with human rights. </p>
<p>This article features striking verbal slippages that point to discursive structures at play. In the article, black female students are consistently referred to as “black women” or “negro college women” while white female students are always referred to as “girls” or “sorority girls.” This pattern of “institution + ‘girls’” vs. “race + ‘women,’” not only identifies black females by race and white females by organizational affiliation, it also points to the larger cultural category of “sorority girl,” a category from which black women were by definition discursively excluded. Further encoding work could engage far more deeply with the gendered aspects of this article, pointing out the gendered-male “negro culture” represented by the conference’s dance and poetry events--once again, all black and African American experiences have been amalgamated and segregated--even as the article supposedly centers on the “negro woman” having “her own culture.” By marking the multitudinous spaces from which black women were excluded--from sorority houses to chapels to TV--perhaps we can begin to see in relief the spaces in which black women might have experienced. </p>
<p>Significantly but unsurprisingly, the article features interviews with sorority members but no interviews with black female students on campus. Because only one voice is allowed to speak for all black women, we do not know from this article what position was taken by black female students on these issues. Furthermore, we can also infer that the event itself was segregated--yet another another gap in the archival record: we can perhaps infer that black and African American people were not included in this event intended to “expose” “sorority girls” to “black culture.” Not only are black women absent from the dialogue around these issues, they are excluded from the event itself. What would black female students have thought of Barbara Hatton’s speech, or of the conference, had they been included? What was their response to this article?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the 1962 article “40 Stage Sit-Ins; No Arrests” features almost no black voices, much less black female voices. The article details the responses of segregated College Park area restaurants to a series of sit-ins. As with the 1969 article, this article engages with segregated spaces in College Park. Even though there is one brief mention of a named black person at the end this article, Marvin A. Raps, President of Prince George’s County chapter of the Congress for Racial Equality, the article focuses on the responses of white people to peaceful acts of civil disobedience. The almost total absence of black voices in this article is countered by the omnipresence of police in efforts to control the spaces in which black people are excluded. Amid the repeated references to various restaurants and College Park locations, the word “police” is only mentioned once, yet the presence of police force is indicated throughout from a certain repeated phrase that could perhaps be easily passed over, even in the title--”no arrests.” The repeated references to arrests indicates that police were on site at each of the sit-ins. As today, police presence shows the presence of congregated black people. It is also important to note that black women's’ experiences of these sit-ins are nowhere indicated; although we assume that black women engaged in these sit-ins, their stories of resistance and protest are lost to us in this text.</p>
With this encoding project I have hoped to show the ways in which the experiences black and African American people have been hidden in the shadows of archival record, make visible the spaces in which white people were allowed and black people were excluded, and delineate the silences and absences of black voices in the University of Maryland archive.
